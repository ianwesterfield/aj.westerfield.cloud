# AJ: Knowledge-Centric AI Infrastructure

A privacy-first, locally-hosted **AJ**entic AI infrastructure assistant that combines intent-driven orchestration with semantic memory—rather than exposing a catalog of tools for an LLM to pick from, the orchestrator reasons about goals and securely dispatches atomic commands to trusted remote agents based on their self-reported capabilities.

**AJ learns learns as you go.** based on a pragmatic and agentic approach. AJ's focus is on:

1. **Privacy** completely local to your environment.
2. **Planning** intelligently based on your workspace and history
3. **Showing Progress** as it works through multi-step tasks
4. **Adapting** based on your feedback and new information
5. **Remembering** what it learns in a semantic vector database
6. **Improving** with every interaction

The AI tooling ecosystem is crowded. Here's where AJ sits — and why it exists.

### The "FunnelCloud Remote Execute" Philosophy

At its core, AJ relies on LLM reasoning and a single tool: `remote_execute`. The LLM generates commands from its training — PowerShell for Windows, Bash for Linux — and the orchestrator runs them on FunnelCloud agents.

- **FunnelCloud agents** on Windows/Linux machines (full capability detection)
- **LLM-generated commands**: The model knows how to construct commands from its training
- **No local execution**: All commands run on remote agents, never in the orchestrator container

The orchestrator doesn't provide bash, file read/write, or code execution tools. Instead, the LLM reasons about what commands to run and uses `remote_execute` to dispatch them to the appropriate agent.

The trick is not only knowing _what_ command to generate, but also _which agent_ to run it on. That's where AJ differs from pure tool-exposure protocols.

### Brain vs. Protocol

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is a specification for exposing tools to LLMs—think of it as a standard interface. It defines how to describe tools, transport requests, and return results. Clean, standard, interoperable.

**MCP is tool-centric:** Servers advertise their tools, hosts discover them, and the LLM picks from the menu. The LLM sees "here are 47 tools" and decides which to call.

**AJ is intent-centric:** The orchestrator reasons about _what needs to happen_, then dispatches atomic operations to agents. Agents don't advertise a menu—they report capabilities ("I can run PowerShell", "I have GPU access"). The orchestrator plans the solution, then sends specific commands: "run this script", "read this file", "execute this query."

```
MCP:  Tools advertise → Host discovers → LLM picks from menu → Execute

AJ:   Intent classified → Orchestrator reasons → Plan steps → Dispatch atomic ops to agents
```

With MCP, the LLM is the decision-maker given a tool catalog. With AJ, the orchestrator is the decision-maker—it reasons about the problem, plans a solution, and agents are just execution endpoints for atomic operations.

**AJ's agents don't think. They execute.** The thinking happens in the orchestrator, informed by session state, history, and the actual capabilities of discovered agents.

**MCP = tool discovery + invocation protocol. AJ = reasoning engine that plans solutions and dispatches atomic operations. Complementary, not competing.**

### Defined Sequence vs. Adaptive Reasoning

Visual workflow builders like [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) are fantastic for deterministic automation: "When X happens, do Y, then Z." You define the sequence, and execution follows that path.

AJ is more like giving directions to a driver. You say where you want to go; it figures out the route:

| Paradigm       | Workflow Builder       | AJ                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **You define** | The exact sequence     | The goal                     |
| **Execution**  | Deterministic (A→B→C)  | Adaptive (LLM chooses steps) |
| **State**      | Workflow variables     | Semantic memory (persistent) |
| **Best for**   | Repeatable automations | Adaptive problem-solving     |

Want "every hour, sync CRM to Sheets"? Use a workflow builder—it's the right tool. Want "help me deploy this to whichever server makes sense"? That requires reasoning, context, and the ability to discover available agents on the fly.

They're complementary. AJ could _be called by_ a workflow builder as an automation step. Or AJ could _call_ external automation when the reasoning engine decides that's the right move.

## How It Works: Plan → Execute → Learn

Every task follows the same learning pattern:

```mermaid

graph TD
    A(["User Task"])
    B["Orient<br/>Analyze session state, memory & intent"]
    C{{"Plan<br/>Generate step-by-step plan"}}
    D>"Execute<br/>Complete the planned list giving real-time updates"]
    E[("Learn<br/>Store insights & patterns")]
    F(["Complete"])

    A --> B --> E --> C --> D --> B
    C --> F
```

This is **agentic reasoning**: not just executing, but thinking, adapting, and learning. You're not talking to a lookup table—you're working with an agent that reasons in real-time.

---

## FunnelCloud: Distributed Agents

For machines that can run software, FunnelCloud agents provide rich capability detection and secure execution. For everything else (switches, appliances, cloud services), the orchestrator uses SSH or API calls directly.

### Why Agents? Self-Describing Infrastructure

A key benefit: **you don't have to teach the LLM your IT stack**. Agents self-report their capabilities at discovery time — installed tools, server roles, platform details. The orchestrator knows what's possible before planning any task.

```
"I need to query Active Directory"
  → Orchestrator sees: domain02 has role:domain-controller
  → Routes AD commands to domain02 automatically

"Restart the web server"
  → Orchestrator sees: webprod01 has role:iis-web-server, webprod02 has role:nginx
  → Asks: "Which web server? IIS on webprod01 or nginx on webprod02?"
```

For network equipment (UniFi, Cisco, etc.), MCP servers can provide the same self-describing pattern — expose device capabilities as tools, and the orchestrator treats them like any other infrastructure.

```mermaid
graph LR
    M{{"AJ<br/>(Orchestrator)"}}
    D>"Docker<br/>(Local Tasks)"]
    W1(["Windows<br/>Machine"])
    L1(["Linux<br/>Workstation"])
    S1(["Server<br/>Farm"])

    M ==>|"mTLS Pinned"| D
    M -.->|"Discover & Execute"| W1
    M -.->|"Discover & Execute"| L1
    M -.->|"Discover & Execute"| S1
```

**Agent Discovery Sequence:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant N as Network (UDP)
    participant A1 as Agent 1
    participant A2 as Agent 2

    Note over O: Conversation starts
    O->>N: UDP Broadcast "FUNNEL_DISCOVER"
    N-->>A1: Discovery packet
    N-->>A2: Discovery packet
    A1-->>O: "I'm here" + capabilities
    A2-->>O: "I'm here" + capabilities
    O->>O: Cache discovered agents

    Note over O: Task execution
    O->>A1: gRPC task (mTLS)
    A1-->>O: Result

    Note over O,A1: Agent fails mid-session
    O-xA1: Connection lost
    O->>N: Re-discover (lazy)
    A2-->>O: Available
    O->>A2: Retry task
```

- **mTLS + fingerprint pinning** (cryptographic identity)
- **Try-then-elevate** permission model
- **One-click deployment** to Windows machines
- **Server role detection** (Windows: DC, DNS, DHCP, Exchange, SQL Server, IIS, Hyper-V, File Server; Linux: nginx, Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes)

**Deploy an agent:**

```powershell
# From the target machine (run as Administrator)
.\Deploy-FunnelCloudAgent.ps1 -BuildServer "your-build-server"
```

See [FunnelCloud/README.md](layers/agents/FunnelCloud/README.md) for full setup guide.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- GPU (recommended for LLM inference)
- Python 3.10+
- Open-WebUI instance
- 20-30GB VRAM (for full stack) or 2-3GB (with Llama7B)

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone <repo>
cd aj.westerfield.cloud
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Configure Open-WebUI connection
export WEBUI_URL=http://localhost:8180
export WEBUI_API_KEY=$(cat secrets/webui_admin_api_key.txt)

# 3. Start all services
docker compose up -d

# 4. Verify services are running
docker compose ps

# 5. Deploy AJ filter to Open-WebUI
./scripts/deploy-filter.ps1
```

### Auto-Start on Windows Boot

To automatically start AJ services when Windows boots (using WSL2 + Docker Engine), create a scheduled task:

```powershell
# Run as Administrator
# Note: Replace 'Debian' with your WSL distro name (check with: wsl -l -v)
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "wsl.exe" -Argument "-d Debian -u root -- bash -c 'service docker start && cd /mnt/c/Code/aj.westerfield.cloud && docker compose up -d'"
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtStartup
$Settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -AllowStartIfOnBatteries -DontStopIfGoingOnBatteries -StartWhenAvailable -RunOnlyIfNetworkAvailable
$Principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId "SYSTEM" -LogonType ServiceAccount -RunLevel Highest
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "AJ-Westerfield-Services" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Settings $Settings -Principal $Principal -Description "Starts AJ services in WSL at system boot"
```

**Verify the task:**

```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName "AJ-Westerfield-Services" | Get-ScheduledTaskInfo
```

**Remove the task (if needed):**

```powershell
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName "AJ-Westerfield-Services" -Confirm:$false
```

---

## Development

### Architecture Principles

- **Knowledge First**: Accumulate and recall what the system learns
- **Reasoning Owns Tools**: Orchestrator decides what to execute, not hardcoded rules
- **Ground Truth Outside**: Session state is authoritative, not the LLM
- **Verbatim Output**: Tools produce raw output; LLM shows it unchanged
- **Specialization Over Generalization**: Small models for specific jobs beat big models for everything

### Model Training

AJ includes infrastructure for fine-tuning DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B with LoRA:

- **Hardware**: DigitalOcean H200 GPU Droplet (141GB VRAM, $3.44/hr)
- **Dataset**: Mixed-v1 (~300K examples: 50% conversational, 40% domain knowledge, 10% strategic reasoning)
- **Context Switching**: Model learns `contextType: external/internal` signal for output mode control
- **Method**: Single-GPU LoRA (no distributed training complexity)
- **Output**: Q4_K_M GGUF for RTX 4090 deployment (~18GB)

See [training/README.md](training/README.md) for complete instructions.

### Extending AJ

**Add a new tool:**

The "FunnelCloud Remote Execute" philosophy means most operations are commands run on agents.
The LLM generates appropriate commands (PowerShell/Bash) from its training.
For truly custom tools, add them to `bash_dispatcher.py`:

```python
# In layers/orchestrator/services/bash_dispatcher.py

# Add to dispatch_tool():
if tool == "custom_tool":
    # Your custom logic here
    return {"success": True, "output": "result", "error": None}
```

**Retrain intent classifier:**

```powershell
cd layers/pragmatics/static
python train_intent_classifier.py    # Takes 2-5 minutes
docker compose up -d --build pragmatics_api
```

## Production Considerations

### Security

- **Encrypted Communication**: mTLS for all agent-to-orchestrator calls
- **Workspace Isolation**: Each user has isolated memory and state
- **Permission Gating**: Tools validate permissions before execution
- **No External Calls**: Everything stays on your infrastructure

### Performance

- **Intent Classification**: <100ms (DistilBERT)
- **Memory Search**: <500ms (Qdrant + embeddings)
- **Tool Execution**: Depends on task (local files = fast, remote tasks = network dependent)
- **Streaming Results**: SSE from orchestrator to filter to user (no wait)

### Scalability

- **Horizontal**: Add more FunnelCloud agents as needed
- **Vertical**: Upgrade orchestrator with larger LLM model
- **Multi-User**: Qdrant can scale to millions of vectors
